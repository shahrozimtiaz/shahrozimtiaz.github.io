		<h2> CS 2150 - Program and Data Representation Course Objectives: </h2>
		<p> 
			Course Description/ General Course Purpose:
			<br>
			*Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures.
			<br>
			*Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs
			<br>
			*Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem

		<h2> CSC 205 - Computer Organization </h2>
		<p>
			Course Description/ General Course Purpose:
			<br>
			Examines the hierarchical structure of computer architecture. Focuses on multi-level machine organization using a simple assembly language. Includes processors, instruction execution, addressing techniques, data representation, and digital logic. Lecture 3 hours per week.
			<br>
			The course should stress the hierarchical structure of a computer. It should incorporate a simple assembly language to serve as an example of how the various components interact. The logic design part of the outline is specific and essential to this course. The functional logic design level is emphasized rather than circuit details, which will be covered in engineering courses. The functional level provides the student with an understanding of the mechanics of information transfer and control within the computer system.
