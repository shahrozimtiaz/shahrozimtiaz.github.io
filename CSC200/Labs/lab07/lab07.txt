Run 1:
How many would you like to get correct?
3
What is 6 - 1 =
5
CORRECT!
What is 9 - 8 =
1
CORRECT!
What is 8 - 4 =
4
CORRECT!
Goodjob! Number Correct: 3 = Want Correct: 3

Run 2:
How many would you like to get correct?
3
What is 4 - 3 =
0
Wrong. 4 - 3 = 1
What is 3 - 0 =
3
CORRECT!
What is 5 - 4 =
1
CORRECT!
What is 5 - 0 =
5
CORRECT!
Goodjob! Number Correct: 3 = Want Correct: 3
